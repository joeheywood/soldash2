sol_gva,"The ONS recently released annual regional output figures for 2022, along with revised figures from 1998 to 2021. London’s GVA for 2020 and 2021 was revised down by 3.65% and 5.18%, respectively. GLA Economics made corresponding sector-level adjustments to ONS quarterly figures for London and developed a projection for 2023. 

The ONS estimates that London's real GVA grew by 4.8% in 2022, outpacing the UK's real GDP growth of 4.3%. Among the UK’s regions, London experienced the largest output increase. GLA Economics estimates that London’s GVA increased by 0.7% in 2023- higher than the UK’s 0.1% GDP increase.

The revised ONS data suggests that London recovered from the pandemic in Q1 2022, while the UK did so in Q4 2021; that said, London recovered more strongly than the UK during 2022. By Q4 2023, both the London and UK economies were 1% larger than their pre-pandemic levels."
sol_spending,"Mastercard data shows that London’s retail spending in inflation-adjusted terms grew and peaked in Q4 2023. Subsequently, it slowed during weekdays and weekends. These figures have not yet recovered to late-2023 levels, although weekend spending rebounded more strongly. Overall, card spending on retail remained resilient despite the cost-of-living crisis. "
sol_fdi,"In Q4 2023, there were 123 new FDI  projects in London (worth £1.3bn in capital expenditure). From 2015-2020, the average was around 150 new projects per quarter (with each quarter averaging £1.7bn in nominal terms). 
Although these figures are still below pre-pandemic levels, they demonstrate a sustained recovery in FDI. From Q4 2022 to Q4 2023, the compound quarterly growth rate (CQGR) of new FDI projects in London was 8.4% per quarter, while capital expenditure grew by 10.6%.

Compared to other global cities, London remains the leading FDI recipient in Europe . The increase in FDI has created more jobs in the city; for example, new tech FDI projects generated over 4,300 jobs in 2023- a 40% year-on-year increase . "
